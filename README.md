# AI vs Human Text Detector

## Overview
The AI vs Human Text Detector project is a machine learning application designed to distinguish between texts generated by artificial intelligence (AI) and those written by humans. This project utilizes state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification and a fine-tuned GPT-2 language model, to accurately classify text samples.

## Features
- **Streamlit Web Application**: The project includes a user-friendly Streamlit web application that allows users to input text and receive predictions on whether it was generated by AI or by a human.
- **SVM Classifier**: The core classification model is based on Support Vector Machine (SVM), a powerful supervised learning algorithm known for its effectiveness in classification tasks.
- **GPT-2 Language Model**: Text processing is performed using a fine-tuned GPT-2 language model, which enables the model to understand and analyze complex textual data effectively.

## Usage
